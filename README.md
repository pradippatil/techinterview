## Why?
?


## How to study a particular topic/concept?
>As advised here: https://googleyasheck.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/

We can't remember everything we studied once. Key to retain knowledge is to practice through repetition. Instead of giving too much time for single topic below method proved useful. This is called [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

* Read or Watch on the topic, to get the main idea
* Implement the algorithms and data structures
* Make flash cards for important things you should remember about the topic ([Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) can be very useful to prepare flash cards)
* Move on to the next topic
* Review the flash cards when you have time
* After another week, read/watch about the topic
* Keep reviewing flash cards
* Wash-Rinse-Repeat

## Choose a language or two to implement the topics learned
Choose the programming language that you are/want to comfortable in to implement everything you will be learning.
I will be using Go and/or Python.
